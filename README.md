# CDEdit: Redactable Blockchain with Cross-audit and Diversity Editing
### ï¼ˆ**This paper accepted by *2022 IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom)*, [please click](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10063601) on the final submission version**)

We use python and the charm framework to implement a highly applicable redactable blockchain (CDEdit), which has controlled editing privileges and supports multi-edit types.

# Note
Since the previous experiment was done in a virtual machine (Ubuntu system), but now it can no longer be opened, tried various methods or not. The only thing I can do now is to back up the source code from the middle of the experiment.
   
Note: Before the paper name is still called "*FitsMe*", but later changed to "*CDEdit*", the code content can be understood by synonymous replacement, does not affect the compilation.
